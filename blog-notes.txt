BLOG NOTES:

- pausing your project and returning to it is a pain in the ass. for me it takes a long retracing steps, as i forget how all the different components of my app fit together. to avoid this, keep a good README. in addition to helping others run your app, it'll be useful to yourself!





- deploy; put in on the cloud!!
why? it helps you coordinate with engineers and devops
